## The SHSM experiential learning and career exploration requirement consists of planned learning activities that take place outside the traditional classroom setting. Experiential learning may take a variety of forms, including:

- one-on-one observation of a co-op student at a placement in the ICT sector (job twinning)
- a day-long observation of an ICT sector worker (e.g., telecommunications technician) (job shadowing)
- a one- or two-week work experience with a member of an industry association or a professional in the ICT sector (e.g., a computer game - developer) (work experience)
- attendance at a sector or trade show, a conference, a symposium, or a job fair
- participation in a local, provincial, or national contest or competition with a focus on ICT
- a tour of a local television/film studio or network monitoring centre
